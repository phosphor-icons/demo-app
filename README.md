# Phosphor Demo App

This is a toy application to demo Phoshor Icons in a desktop application context. Phosphor is a flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations — whatever, really.

- 772 icons and counting
- 6 weights: **Thin**, **Light**, **Regular**, **Bold**, **Fill**, and **Duotone**
- Designed at 16 x 16px to read well small and scale up big
- Raw stroke information retained to fine-tune the style
